# already produced, which is a *simplified* offset of the reference
# contour (dem.select_reference_contour_xy()'s simplify_tolerance_m,
# default 1.5x the DEM grid resolution — currently 1.5m at the UI's
# default 1.0m resolution). Between two of that polyline's original
# vertices the row is geometrically a straight chord; dropping waypoints
# along it at 1m spacing places nodes exactly ON that chord, not on the
# true elevation isoline the chord approximates. If tighter tracking than
# the simplify tolerance matters, lower "DEM grid resolution" in the
# Mission sidebar (tightens simplify_tolerance_m too) rather than
# shortening this interval — a denser waypoint chain along the same

    Why this exists: a route between rows must hug the headland and never
    angle across a crop row. The IN/OUT label is NOT a reliable proxy for
    which physical end a node sits at — snake (boustrophedon) ordering flips
    the label↔end correspondence on alternate rows. So we classify ends by
    geometry: rows are long, so the two ends sit at the extremes of the
    row-length axis (the coordinate with the larger spread). Split nodes into
    two ends on that axis, then order each end along the cross (along-headland)
    axis and pair consecutive nodes. Chaining neighbours (never skip-linking)
    keeps every edge between physically adjacent row-ends, so A* walks the
    headland instead of cutting a chord across a row mouth.

    Used by both save_f2c_rows_to_topo (initial build) and
