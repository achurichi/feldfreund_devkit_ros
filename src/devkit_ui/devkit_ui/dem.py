dem.py
──────
Builds a DEM (elevation grid) from sparse recon points — the CSV logged by
devkit_driver/modules/recon_dem_logger.py — then derives a traversability
mask from it. This is the missing link between recon logging and
terrain_mask.py's ring vectorizer (see repo issue #110):

    recon.csv --[this module]--> elevation grid --[this module]--> traversable
        mask --[terrain_mask.py]--> obstacle_rings --[f2c_planner]--> _run_f2c()

Interpolation backend: scipy.interpolate.RBFInterpolator. RTK recon points
are metres apart, not point-cloud density, so a thin-plate spline is enough
— no need for grid_map_pcl or a C++ dependency. `_interpolate_elevation()`
is the single seam to swap in verde.Spline later if RBF proves too crude on
real field data; the points-in/grid-out shape is the same for both, so that
swap should be a one-function change, not a rewrite. (Measured against
verde.Spline on synthetic noisy data: comparable accuracy at matched
regularization — the RBF-vs-Spline choice isn't the thing that matters
here, see below.)

`_choose_smoothing()`'s cross-validation loop is adapted from
verde.SplineCV's approach — grid-search a set of regularization candidates,
score each against held-out folds, keep the lowest-error one — credit:
fatiando/verde (github.com/fatiando/verde), BSD-3-Clause License,
Copyright (c) 2017 The Verde Developers. Reimplemented directly on top of
RBFInterpolator instead of depending on verde.SplineCV, because Verde's
*only* runtime dependency this module would actually use is that CV loop —
`import verde` unconditionally pulls in pandas, xarray, scikit-learn, dask,
and pooch (measured: ~2.4s import time) for a package meant to run on an
embedded SBC (Avaota A1). Not worth it for one grid-search loop.

`elevation_to_traversable()` mirrors the slope math in
devkit_bringup/config/terrain_traversability_filters.yaml's filter3/filter4
(acos(normal_z) threshold) so behaviour matches if that grid_map_filters
chain is ever wired in instead of this.

Pure functions, no ROS dependency — callers read the CSV themselves and
pass plain numpy arrays, same convention as terrain_mask.py.
